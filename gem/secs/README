SECS 0.2 (Milestone 2, Dec 2 2008)

This is SECS, a Tcl library which forms the basis of
an Semiconductor Equipment Server/Manager/Simulator
or whatever you like to call it. Any piece of software
which wants to communicate to another device using
the SECS/HSMS protocol can use this library.

HOW TO INSTALL THE LIBRARY:

First, make sure you have Tcl 8.5 or later
installed for your platform. The library simply
consists of a single file:
    secs-0.2.0.tm
Just copy this file to some place where Tcl
can find it, e.g.:
    C:\Tcl\lib\tcl8\8.5 (windows)
    /usr/local/lib/tcl8/8.5 (UNIX)
If the directory cannot be found by Tcl yet,
set the environment variable TCL8_5_TM_PATH to
the directory where secs-0.2.0.tm is (or its
parent). That's all there is to do.

HOW TO CREATE A SIMPLE SERVER.

The most simple server can be written as follows:

======== begin server.tcl ========
package require secs
namespace eval server {
    set RTY 3
    set SOFTWARE {L {A SECS} {A 0.2}}
    set T0 60000
    set T1 1000
    set T2 10000
    set T3 45000
    set T4 45000
    set T5 10000
    set T6 5000
    set T7 10000
    set T8 5000
    secs init {} 6500
}
vwait forever
======== end server.tcl ========

Running this file, it will start up a server
listening on port 6500 using the HSMS protocol.
Sending any valid SECS message to it, the server
will always answer with an Acknowledge. If you
request it's software version, it will report
SECS 0.2, and some more basic things.

Now you can modify the behavior of the server,
by defining your own procs in this namespace.

For more information, see the documentation which
can be found on secs.sf.net.
